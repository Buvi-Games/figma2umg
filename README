# Figma2UMG

**Import your Figma designs directly into Unreal Engine UMG** — turning your Figma frames into usable UMG widgets automatically.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Figma2UMG** is an Unreal Engine plugin developed by Buvi Games that brings your Figma UI designs into Unreal with just a few clicks. It’s designed to accelerate UI prototyping and align design and development workflows by translating visual layouts into native UMG components.

Originally released on the Epic Marketplace, this plugin is now **open source and free to use** — with continued support for existing users.

- 🧩 Preserves hierarchy and nesting of UI elements

- 🎨 Basic styling: fills, positions, sizes
- 📁 Generates Blueprint UserWidgets for rapid iteration

---

## 🛠 Limitations

- Only one Figma frame (canvas) is supported per import
- No gradient, outline, text wrapping or justification support (yet)
- Some assets may require cleanup after import
- Unreal Engine restart may be necessary after import to refresh references
